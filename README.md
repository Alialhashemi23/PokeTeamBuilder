# 🧩 PokeTeamBuilder
*A flexible Pokémon team-building app built with .NET + C#.*

## 📌 Overview
PokeTeamBuilder is a modern C#/.NET application designed to help players create, manage, and visualize Pokémon teams efficiently. It interacts with the public **PokeAPI**, supports bulk fetching of Pokémon data, and provides structured models and services that make extending the app easy.

This project is built with clean architecture principles in mind — separating concerns across models, services, and API interactions — making it ideal for learning, experimenting, or expanding into a fully featured team builder.
